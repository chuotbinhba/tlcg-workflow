Project name: TLCG Workflow

Project overview:
TLCG Workflow is a simplified Business Management System inspired by Kissflow.
It is a web-based platform that enables users to create, manage, and automate
business processes and workflows with ease.

Primary goals:
- Deliver a simple, intuitive workflow management system
- Enable easy configuration and automation of business processes
- Maintain long-term scalability without unnecessary complexity

Architecture & coding standards:
- Use clean architecture principles
- Clearly separate concerns (domain, application, infrastructure, UI)
- Prefer readability and maintainability over clever or condensed code
- Follow the existing folder and module structure consistently

Engineering rules:
- Always recommend industry best practices
- Prefer simplicity over over-engineering
- Assume production-scale usage and real-world constraints
- Avoid breaking changes unless explicitly requested

When suggesting solutions:
- Evaluate the existing codebase before introducing new patterns
- Recommend best-practice approaches appropriate to the project’s current scale
- Explain trade-offs between alternative solutions
- Clearly explain WHY a solution is recommended
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies or abstractions
